## About

This is a fictitious band's website. The Funked Up Chicks' online presence is the result of a lack of inspiration for something good to do without the help of JS and preferring music bands to the other suggested topics.

## User Stories

  - I want to know immediately what the band is about and what kind of musical experience to expect.

  - I'd like for the website to be engaging and interesting to look at and explore without having the allure of a band i like encouraging me to look around.

- Someone who has heard of the band but knows little or nothing about them

  - (See previous user story)

## Design and Creation

I wanted to create a website that was representative of the genre of music but had character of its own as well. When designing the website I first came up with the genre I wanted the band to be in. I chose funk because it's a great genre of music, and one that I love very much, but also because it seemed like a colourful genre in which I could explore lots of different ideas and be creative. <br>
<br>
The next phase was coming up with the name, something which would pin down some points of the character of the band and thus the website. "Pumped up kicks" by Foster the People served as inspiration for the name, the derviation obvious there. A group of women who've got their funk on!<br>
<br>
With an image of the band now in my mind I could see what their image would be. I pictured three women with colorful hair and style and wearing sixties/seventies clothes. I don't know why myabe because that is when funk came into existance first. Nonetheless it was formed in my mind as such and so I would commit to it. With this now sort of old school image in place I liked the idea of using records in the website and having them play a central role in tying the site together.<br>
<br>
I went to work on the mockups, piecing things together as i went. The records took a backseat and onkly one ended up as the backdrop to the homepage and a record shop featured in a couple of other pages, however the old school style came through other design features such as brown paper backdrops and floral header creations. It was only when programming the website that I found inspiration to use the records more effectively in the design of the website.
